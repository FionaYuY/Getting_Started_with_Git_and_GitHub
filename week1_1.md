# Getting Starteed with Git and GitHub
## Course Introduction
1. Git and GitHub are widely used for version control and collaborative software development.

## Overview of Git and GitHub
1. A 'version control system' lets you track your changes to the source code.
   - More easy for you to recover older versions of your document
   - Makes collaboration with other team members much easier
2. Git
   - Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), meaning users anywhere in the world can have a copy of your project on their computer
   - When someone mde changes, they can sync theri version to remote server to share it to others.
   - Git isn't the only version control system but the distributed aspect is one of the main reason that it has become popular.
3. Version control systems are widely used for things involving code, but you can also version control images, documents, and any number of file types.
4. Git also supports branching strategies such as feature branching to organize and mangage development.
5. You can use Git without a web interface using the command lined interface but GitHub is one of the most popular web hosted service for Git repositories.
   - Some others includes Git Lab, Bitbucket, and Beanstock
6. Basic terms
   - SSH protocol (secure shell): is a method for a secure remote login from one computer to another
   - Repository: contains your project folders that are set up for version control
   - Fork: is a copy of a repository
   - Pull request: is how you request that someone review and approve your changes before they become final
   - Working directory: Contains the files and subdirectories on your computer that are associated with a Git repository.
   - Commit: is a snapshot of the project's current state at a specific point in time along with a description of the changes made.
   - Branch: is a separate line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes independently
   - Merging: combines changes from one branch into another, typically merging a feature branch into the main branch
   - Cloning: creates a local copy of a remote Git repository on your computer 

## Introduction to GitHub
1. Background of Git
   - Large sofware projects need a way to track and control source code updates
   - Linux needs automated source-version control
   - Key characteristics include:
     + Strong support for non-linear development
     + Distributed development
     + Compatibility with existing systems and protocols
2. Linux Development and Git
   - Early 2000s: **Linux development** used BitKeeper, a free-to-use system.
   - 2005: BitKeeper became for-fee, problematic for developers.
   - **Linus Torvalds** led development of an alternative source-version control system.
3. Key Characteristics of the Replacement System
   - Strong support for **non-linear development** (6.7 patches/sec).
   - **Distributed development**: Developers have local copies of the full history.
   - Compatibility with existing systems/protocols.
   - Efficient handling of **large projects**.
   - **Cryptographic authentication** of history.
   - Pluggable merge strategies for complex integrations.
4. Special Features of Git
   - **Distributed version-control system** created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds.
   - Focus on tracking **source code** during development.
   - Supports coordination among programmers, tracking changes, and **non-linear workflows**.
5. GitHub and GitLab
   - **IBM Cloud** uses open-source tools including Git repositories.
   - **GitHub**: Online hosting for Git repositories with over 100M repositories as of August 2019.
     + Offers free, professional, and enterprise accounts.
     + Hosted by a subsidiary of Microsoft.
     + Repositories track documents and source code with version control.
   - **GitLab**: A single-application **DevOps platform**.
     + Provides access to Git repositories and source code management.
     + Facilitates collaboration, code review, branching, merging.
     + Includes Built-in **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**.
6. In a central version control system, every developer needs to check out code from the central system and commit back into it. As git is a distributed version cotrol, each developer has a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. Eahc developer can act as a hub.
